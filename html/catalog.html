            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    "We had the great pleasure of Gustav coming to our PhD School Symposium May 2025 and host a workshop
                    on AI/ML and how it is used in big pharma.
                    From start to finish Gustav was very professional and tailored his workshop to the topics that we
                    knew we wanted to learn about - and then some. He was spot on and had prepared a very nice
                    interactive workshop. He was engaging and even stayed for longer answering all the questions we had.
                    I would highly recommend hiring Gustav for a unique insight in AI/ ML and research in big pharma!"
